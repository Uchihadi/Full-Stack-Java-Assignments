            (CNN)The Queen's coffin has arrived at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, following a six-hour journey from Balmoral Castle to the Scottish capital.

            Crowds of mourners lined the streets of villages and cities, paying tribute to the monarch as her cortege made its way across Scotland on the first of the Queen's 8-day journey to her final resting place.
            Britain's longest-serving monarch died Thursday at the age of 96 at her Scottish country estate in Balmoral. Her funeral will be held in London on September 19.<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/11/uk/queen-elizabeth-final-journey-intl-gbr/index.html"> Read More Here..</a>

        <h3> Ukrainian military: Russians flee strategic town in Luhansk </h3>
        <p>
            In a statement Sunday, the Ukrainian military's general staff said that Russian forces had abandoned the town of Svatove in Luhansk region, a town that until Saturday was still 40 kilometers (25 miles) beyond the known front line of the Ukrainian advance.

            Svatove has been an important hub on Russian resupply routes to the front lines further south - along the borders of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

            "The occupiers have abandoned Svatove in Luhansk region," the general staff's office said in a Facebook post. "They rushed away in four Kamaz trucks, twenty Tigr AVs [armored vehicles] and stole over 20 cars of local residents."

            CNN cannot independently verify the Ukrainian account.

            The general staff's office also claimed that "as a result of the successful counteroffensive of our troops in the Kharkiv direction, the Russian troops frantically leave their positions and flee with the loot deep into the temporarily occupied territories or into the territory of the Russian Federation."

    <h3> Premier League considering 'swapping' stadiums for next weekend's matches </h3>
    <p>
        The Premier League are reportedly mulling over the possibility of swapping venues in a bid to try and ensure next weekend's fixtures are fulfilled ahead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral.

        Football made the decision to postpone all fixtures this weekend as a mark of respect to The Queen, who sadly passed away on Thursday at the age of 96 at her Balmoral estate. EFL matches are set to resume in midweek while English clubs participating in Europe are also poised to return to action over the coming days.

        However, there are concerns that some of next weekend's fixtures could be affected by The Queen's funeral, which will take place on Monday, September 19.
